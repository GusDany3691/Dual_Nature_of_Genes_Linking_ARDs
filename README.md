# Dual_Nature_of_Genes_Linking_ARDs

Here we present the code files for the paper "The dual nature of genes linking multiple ageing-related diseases"

We split the content into two folders. One from data, which contains final results, specielly from the ML algorithms, coexpression and tissue specificity profiles. The second folder contains the R and Python scripts that shaed the project.
